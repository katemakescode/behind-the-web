# Behind the Web

Behind the Web is a personal portfolio webpage, and wrapper for the OverTrick and Mercantile projects.
The styling is deliberately minimalist; I'm not a web designer, and I'd rather spend my time crafting 
back end infrastructure and business logic.
 
Note: the page should render adequately on both desktop and mobile, but has only been tested
on Chrome 85 on Linux Mint. 


## Roadmap
* Merchant ecommerce stub
* scrollspy and roll up labels
* Akismet
* 404 and 500 pages
* message logging
* wider testing
