# TinyPage

TinyPage is a personal portfolio site, and wrapper for the OverTrick and
 Swag projects.


## OverTrick

OverTrick is a web application to display and analyse club 
[Duplicate Bridge](https://cdn.acbl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Laws-of-Duplicate-Bridge.pdf)
pairs results. It is intended to be a demonstration of development skill rather
 than something that would necessarily be used in the field.  
 
The data is currently gleaned from [NZ Scorer](https://bridgenz.co.nz/scorer
), which collates results data from clubs across New Zealand. I don't have
 extensive knowledge of Bridge, so the application may not reflect exact play.
